# Boost Your Revenue  From $2 to $10 Per Recipient


## Introduction
Welcome email series are the cornerstone of any successful email marketing strategy, generating an average of $2.13 per recipient. However, when executed properly, this number can skyrocket to $5-$10 per recipient. With the potential to drive 10-15% of your total revenue, a well-crafted welcome series is not just an option—it's a necessity for e-commerce success.

## The Foundation: Creating an Effective Sign-Up Form

### Choose the Right Format
While Klaviyo offers multiple sign-up form options (pop-up, flyout, embed), pop-ups consistently outperform others because:
- They appear center-screen
- They require active engagement (subscribe or close)
- They're impossible to miss

### The Hierarchy of Converting Elements
1. **Offer (Most Important)**
   - Free gift with purchase (highest converter)
   - Free shipping
   - Percentage discount
   - Dollar amount off
   - Monthly giveaway entry

2. **Copy (Second Most Important)**
   - Keep it clean and straightforward
   - Focus on value proposition
   - Use micro-commitments ("Would you like to save?")

3. **Design (Least Important)**
   - Clean, modern aesthetic
   - Mobile-friendly
   - Doesn't need to be complex (simple forms often convert at 10-14%)

### Optimal Timing and Targeting
**Desktop:**
- Trigger: Exit-intent
- Frequency: 7-14 days between shows
- Target: Non-subscribers only

**Mobile:**
- Trigger: 8 seconds or 60% scroll
- Frequency: Similar to desktop
- Consider separate forms for email vs. SMS collection
