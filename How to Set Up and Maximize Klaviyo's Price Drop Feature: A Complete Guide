## Introduction
Klaviyo's Price Drop feature, introduced in 2021, enables e-commerce businesses to automatically notify customers when products they've shown interest in become more affordable. This guide will walk you through the setup process and share best practices for maximizing conversions.

## Setting Up Price Drop Automation

### Step 1: Accessing the Feature
1. Log into your Klaviyo account
2. Navigate to "Flows"
3. Click on "Create Flow"
4. Select "Price Drop" from the template options (or create from scratch)

### Step 2: Configure Price Drop Triggers
You can set up price drop notifications based on two main criteria:

**Price Reduction Type:**
- By Amount ($)
- By Percentage (%) - Recommended for most businesses
  - Optimal range: 5-50% price reduction
  - Consider your profit margins when setting this threshold

**Trigger Conditions:**
1. Person who viewed specific product
2. Person who started checkout with specific product
3. Person who viewed item OR started checkout (recommended for broader reach)

### Step 3: Set Time Window
- Default setting: 30 days
- Recommended range: 30-60 days
- Consider your product cycle and customer behavior patterns

## Advanced Segmentation Strategy

### Creating Targeted Customer Segments
Use conditional splits in your flow to create personalized messaging:

**First-Time vs. Returning Customers:**
```
Condition: Placed Order Count
- 0 times (new customers)
- 1+ times (existing customers)
```

### Messaging Strategy by Segment:

**New Customers:**
- More aggressive marketing approach
- Emphasis on value proposition
- Consider additional first-time purchase incentives

**Existing Customers:**
- Softer, relationship-focused approach
- Reminder of previous interest
- Focus on product benefits they already trust

## Best Practices

### Price Drop Percentage
- Start with 5% minimum drop
- Test different thresholds for your market
- Consider seasonal variations

### Email Content Tips
1. Clear price comparison (old vs. new)
2. Sense of urgency without being pushy
3. Mobile-optimized design
4. Clear call-to-action buttons

### Timing Considerations
1. Monitor customer engagement patterns
2. Test different send times
3. Consider time zones for international customers

## Measuring Success

Key Metrics to Track:
- Open rates by segment
- Click-through rates
- Conversion rates
- Revenue per email
- Unsubscribe rates

## Implementation Example

For a $100 product:
```
Price Drop: 5%
New Price: $95
Segmentation:
- New Customers: Strong conversion focus
- Existing Customers: Relationship-building approach
```

## Conclusion
Klaviyo's Price Drop feature offers a powerful way to recover potentially lost sales and engage price-sensitive customers. By properly segmenting your audience and personalizing your approach, you can turn browser interest into actual sales while maintaining customer relationships.
